# Efficient-and-Fast-Wind-Turbine-MPPT-Algorithm-Using-TS-Fuzzy-Logic-and-Optimal-Relation-Methods
This repository presents the simulation file used to demonstrate the effectiveness of Efficient and Fast Wind Turbine MPPT Algorithm Using TS Fuzzy Logic and Optimal Relation Methods.

The following figure shows the block diagram of the wind turbine implementation based on the PIL simulation approach.

The description of the files is as follows:

  M_GITHUB.m  contains the simulation parameters.

  S_GITHUB.slx is the simulation circuit of the wind turbine energy system with all algorithms (TS-MPPT, PI-MPPT, MA-MPPT, and Oubella-MPPT).

  S_PIL_BLOCK.slx contains the PIL block of all algorithms.

  TS_MPPT.fis  is the fuzzy system of the TS-MPPT algorithm.

  MA_MPPT.fis is the fuzzy system of the MA-MPPT algorithm.

  OUBELLA_MPPT.fis is the fuzzy system of the Oubella-MPPT algorithm.

  Rotor.jpg is the image of the wind rotor of the wind system.

  WIND_PERFIL.mat is the fluctuating wind profile used for wind system evaluation
